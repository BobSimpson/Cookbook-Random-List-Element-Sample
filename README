This program implements the algorithm from the Perl Cookbook
http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/perl/cookbook/ch08_07.htm

The explanation there is pretty good, but the "code" they show doesn't
actually work.

So...

Assuming you don't want to load the whole data set into memory, this lets
you go through the list one item at a time and determine if "this one"
is the "right answer" if this is the last item in the list, thus:

Item #1. There is a 100% chance (1/1) this item will be selected, if
this is the last item in the list. Put it in your pocket.

Item #2. There is a 50% chance (1/2) this item will be selected, if
this is the last item in the list.  Generate a random number, and if
it's less than 1/2, put this item in your pocket instead.

Item #3. There is a 33.3% chance (1/3) this item will be selected, if
this is the last item in the list.  Generate a random number, and if
it's less than 1/3, put this item in your pocket instead.

...later...

Item #3,839,113. There is a (1/3839113) chance this item will be selected,
if this is the last item in the list.  Generate a random number, and if
it's less than 1/3839113, put this item in your pocket instead.

At some point you will reach the end of the list and return the last
item you put in your pocket as the selected item.

There are faster ways to select an item from a set where you have more
information about the data set or can pull the whole thing into memory
and do some analysis.

But if you don't, this works pretty well and is fun to explain.
